Javascript Challenge: Password Generator

In this challenge, we were asked to finish a javascript code that would generate a random password based off of user's choice of how many characters to be involved with the password, and if they want upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters to be included in their generated password.  


## Usage

When they click on the generate button, a promp window will appear asking how many characters should be in the password.  The user must pick a number between 8 - 128. After picking the quantity, they are giving other confirm windows if they want the upper or lower case letters, numbers or special characters. They must pick at least one of these options in order to get a password, if they deny all, then a prompt window will appear letting them know they need to pick at least one type of character.  

When selecting all of the user's options, the generator will randomly pick characters out of the options until the amount of characters are filled for the preferred length of the password.  Then it will display in the password box that is in the HTML/CSS.
